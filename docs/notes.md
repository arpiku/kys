## First commit
- The goal of the program is simple, to allow users to convert their keyboards into full macro keyboards.


Goals for v0.1
~~- A command line tool that lists all the available input devices and allow user to select the ones they wish
to use for macros.~~ 

~~- Generating config (a file containing individual function for each available key press) file for each device.~~
