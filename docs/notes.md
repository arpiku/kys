## First commit
- The goal of the program is simple, to allow users to convert their keyboards into full macro keyboards.


Goals for v0.1
- A command line tool that lists all the available input devices and allow user to select the ones they wish
to use for macros.
- Generating config file for each device, with each input mapped to it's original action, this original action
now can be replaced with anything the user wants.
